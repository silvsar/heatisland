            <h1>Urban Heat Island Effect Intensifies Temperature Differences in Helsinki</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="byline">
            <p>By <a>Sara Silvennoinen</a></p>

        <p>This summer, Finland has experienced an exceptionally powerful heatwave, with record-breaking temperatures and unusually prolonged periods of hot weather.</p>

        <p>The heatwave was especially intense in urban areas like Helsinki. However, there are also significant differences within the capital area itself.</p>
        <p>Data from temperature measurement stations, collected by the Finnish Meteorological Institute, reveal dramatic contrasts between the city center and the outskirts of Helsinki.</p>
        <p>The stations in city centre Kamppi and suburban town Haltiala, although only about 12 kilometers apart, show a remarkable temperature difference during the heatwave.</p> 
        <figure>
            <img src="graph4.png" alt="Map of Helsinki showing the locations of 31 temperature measurement stations, highlighting Kamppi in the city center and Haltiala in the northern suburbs, which are about 12 kilometers apart.">
            <figcaption>Map: Sara Silvennoinen.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>On July 16th, the late-night temperature in Kamppi was as much as 9.29°C higher than in Haltiala. This striking contrast underlines how urban environments, with their dense buildings and asphalt, retain much more heat compared to greener, suburban areas like Haltiala.</p> 
        <figure>
            <img src="graph1.png" alt="Graph showing late-night temperature differences in Helsinki from July 16 to July 24, 2025. Kamppi (city center) consistently recorded temperatures over 9°C higher than Haltiala (suburban area), with specific values marked for both locations each night.">

        </figure>

        <p>Not only were the nighttime temperatures significantly higher in Kamppi, but the rate at which each area cooled also differed greatly.</p>
        <p>During the evening and night, Kamppi's temperature dropped much more slowly than Haltiala's. For example, between 18:00 and 03:00, Kamppi cooled by only 5°C, while Haltiala's temperature dropped by 10.6°C. This means Kamppi held onto heat more than two times longer than the suburban area.</p>

             <p>Correction: Kamppi cooled down 2 times faster, not three, as it says in the graph.</p>
